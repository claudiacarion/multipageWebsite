      <p class="intro">
        For as long as I can remember, I was fascinated by computers. It amazed
        me that with a few clicks here and there, the computer would do things I
        wanted it to do. So I'm not exaggerting when I say my mind was blown the
        first time I was introduced to HTML. What?! I typed a bunch of things on
        Notepad and it turned into a website?! That was the Y2K. Since then, no
        matter what I was studying or which field I was working in, I was always
        led back to computers and technology. After working in education for
        many years, I decided to combine my passion for creativity with my
        interest in technology and pursue a career as a developer. I completed
        School of Applied Technology Stockholm's Fullstack Javascript Bootcamp
        in 2022 and now I am a student in Futuregames Stockholm's Frontend
        Developer program.
